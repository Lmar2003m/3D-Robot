# üîß Engineering Model Enhancement ‚Äì Modification Report

This project showcases the process of improving a 3D model using Onshape, with the goal of enhancing visual and mechanical balance and improving structural performance. The modifications were applied to the original model to achieve a more professional and functional design.

## ‚ú® Modifications Implemented

### 1. Addition of a Central Hole
- Description: A circular hole was added midway between the two side holes.
- Benefit: Improves force distribution and enhances visual symmetry in the design.

### 2. Insertion of Internal Support Triangles (Ribs)
- Description: Triangular geometric features were added inside the model to reinforce the structure using the Thin Extrude feature.
- Benefit: Increases structural rigidity while reducing weight and maintaining strength.

### 3. Use of Fillet to Smooth Edges
- Description: Sharp corners were smoothed using the Fillet feature.
- Benefit: Reduces mechanical stress, improves aesthetics, and facilitates manufacturing.

### 4. Addition of External Support Triangle
- Description: An external triangle was added between the arm and the base.
- Benefit: Acts as a structural brace to better distribute forces, increase stability, and reduce vibrations.

### 5. Organization of Sketches and Features
- Description: Design elements were neatly arranged within Onshape.
- Benefit: Easier future modifications and clearer design workflow.
